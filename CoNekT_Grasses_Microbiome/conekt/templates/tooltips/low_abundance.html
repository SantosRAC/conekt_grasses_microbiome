    <div><strong>Low (Transcript) Abundance</strong></div>
    <hr />
    <p>Some transcripts have low abundance in all conditions in the expression profiles. For these genes, random
       stochastic effects can cause sharp peaks in their profile. These are likely <strong>not</strong> biologically
       relevant and should be interpreted with <strong>caution</strong>.</p>
