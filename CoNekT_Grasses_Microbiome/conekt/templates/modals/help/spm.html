    <p>The <em>specificity measure</em> (SPM) ranges from 0 to 1 and can be calculated for each condition/tissue. The value indicates how large the contribution is from one
        condition/tissue to the entire expression profile 0 being no contribution and 1 being the only condition/tissue expressed. In CoNekT the SPM for each
        condition/tissue was calculated and only the highest one was stored. In combination with an arbitrary threshold SPM can be used to find codition/tissue specific genes.

    SPM has been used in TiSGeD <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20223836" alt="PubMed blast ref" class="badge">PubMed</a></p>
