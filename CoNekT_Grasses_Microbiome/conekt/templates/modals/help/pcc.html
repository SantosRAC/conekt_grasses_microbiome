    <p>The Pearson Correlation Coefficient or PCC is the degree of correlation between two variables X and Y. Here the
       PCC is used to assert the similarity between expression profiles. The PCC ranges from -1 to 1 where 1 indicates
       perfect correlation between variables, 0 indicates no-correlation and -1 is perfect anti-correlation. When
       constructing co-expression networks 0.7 is used as a cutoff value for PCC values.</p>
