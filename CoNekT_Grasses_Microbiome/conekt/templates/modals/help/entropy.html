    <p>The entropy of a profile is related with how many fluctuations there are. Housekeeping genes with a very narrow
    range of expression will have low-entropy, genes very specific for single condition and low expression elsewhere too. Genes
    that have a wide range of different expression values have higher entropy.</p>
