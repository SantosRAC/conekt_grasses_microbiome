# Building CoNekt Grasses Microbiome

## Using the admin panel to build CoNekT Grasses Microbiome

### Add Taxonomy

TODO: Add a description of the taxonomy

 * NCBI Taxonomy (not implemented yet; under implementation)
 * SILVA Taxonomy
 * RDP Taxonomy (not implemented yet)
 * GreenGenes Taxonomy (not implemented yet)

### Add Species

TODO: Add a description of the species

 * 

### Add Functional Data

TODO: Add a description of functional data available

 * InterPro
 * Gene Ontology
 * CAZymes


### Add Ontologies

TODO: Add a description of the ontologies

 * Plant Ontology (PO)
 * Plant Experimental Condition Ontology (PECO)
 * Host Microbiome Interaction Ontology (OHMI) (not implemented yet)
 * Environment Ontology (ENVO) (not implemented yet)
 * Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) (not implemented yet)

### Add Samples

TODO: Add a description of the samples

 * DNA or RNA (ECO might be used here)
 * Associated with a plant (any grass)
 * Associated with plant tissue/organ (if available, also associate with plant development stage and particular conditions, such as drought stress)
 * Associated with literature item (any publication with DOI, if available)

### Add Sequencing Runs

TODO: Add a description of the sequencing runs
Note: ECO might be used here

 * RNAseq or metataxonomics-based
 * Sequencing technology

### Add gene families

 * Orthogroups from OrthoFinder2 (DMRP suggested to import the Orthogroups file using an alternative approach)
 * Gene trees, also from OrthoFinder2

### Add Species clades

TODO: Add a description of the species clades

 * Phylogeny of grass species
 * Phylogeny of bacterial species


### Create study (-ies)

 * Transcriptome-only
 * Metataxonomics-only
 * Integration of transcriptome and metataxonomics

### Add expression data and build associated results

 * Add expression profiles
 * Add co-expression networks
 * Compute expression speficicity

### Add metataxonomic data and build associated results

 * Add metataxonomic profiles (OTU or ASV counts)
 * FUTURE: add co-occurrence networks
 * FUTURE: Compute diversity metrics

### Add integration data and build associated results

 * Add correlation analyses (grass genes vs. bacterial species)
