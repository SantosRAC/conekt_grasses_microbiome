# Building CoNekt Grasses Microbiome

## Using the admin panel to build CoNekT Grasses Microbiome

### Add Taxonomy

TODO: Add a description of the taxonomy

 * SILVA Taxonomy
 * GTDB Taxonomy
 * GreenGenes Taxonomy

### Add Species

TODO: Add a description of the species

 * 

### Add Functional Data

TODO: Add a description of functional data available

 * InterPro
 * Gene Ontology
 * CAZymes


### Add Ontologies

TODO: Add a description of the ontologies

 * Plant Ontology (PO)
 * Plant Experimental Condition Ontology (PECO)
 * Environment Ontology (ENVO)

### Add Samples

TODO: Add a description of the samples

 * DNA or RNA
 * Associated with a plant (any grass)
 * Associated with plant tissue/organ (if available, also associate with plant development stage and particular conditions, such as drought stress)
 * Associated with literature item (any publication with DOI, if available)

### Add Sequencing Runs

TODO: Add a description of the sequencing runs

 * RNAseq or metataxonomics-based
 * Sequencing technology


### Create study (-ies)

 * Metataxonomics-only
 * Integration of transcriptome and metataxonomics

### Add expression data and build associated results

 * Add expression profiles
 * Add co-expression networks
 * Compute expression speficicity

### Add metataxonomic data and build associated results

 * Add metataxonomic profiles (OTUs)
 * Add classification to OTUs
 * FUTURE: add co-occurrence networks
 * FUTURE: Compute diversity metrics

### Add integration data and build associated results

 * Add correlation analyses (grass genes vs. bacterial species)
